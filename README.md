This project takes the base create-react-app template and adds the ArcGIS JS API v4.x. It is a simpler version of https://github.com/davetimmins/create-react-app-arcgis as this uses the [esri-loader](https://github.com/Esri/esri-loader) and [esri-loader-react](https://github.com/davetimmins/esri-loader-react) modules and so doesn't need to have the `npm eject` task run.

run `yarn install`
then `npm start`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
